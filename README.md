# TinyShiny

The data used in this Shiny web app was derrived from a study by Maria Saxton, 
a Ph.D. candidate in environmental design and planning at Virginia Tech.
The study included a survey from 80 participants who downsized to homes under
400 square feet and explored the environmental impact of downsizing.
Environmental impact was measured by the change in the individual's 
Ecological Footprint (EF) in global hectares (gha's) as defined by The Global Footprint Network.  
Saxton's study hopes to bridge gaps of scholarly knowledge on this topic to improve 
the currently unsustainable building practices in the residential sector.
